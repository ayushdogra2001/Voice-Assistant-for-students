# Voice-Assistant-for-students
everyone knows what a voice assistant is,for example Siri,Cortana bla bla bla... this one is specially for students where one can check for attendance, listen music, make a note, ask a doubt. we have used pytsx3 as the voice modular and google's speech recogniser for recognizing the speech. We have also implemented NLP in this project.
